## Overview

As AI workloads in the cloud become increasingly costly, this project offers best practices and tools to reduce AI infrastructure expenses while maintaining efficiency. It focuses on leveraging the principles of Financial Operations (FinOps) to optimize AI-related cloud costs. The goal is to provide actionable insights and automation to manage compute, storage, and other AI resources effectively.

## Features

- **Cost Monitoring**: Tools for monitoring cloud expenses in real-time, with dashboards and alerts for overspending.
- **Optimization Tips**: Best practices and automated suggestions for optimizing AI workloads based on resource utilization.
- **AI-specific FinOps**: Tailored strategies for AI models, training costs, and inference pipelines in the cloud.
- **Cost Allocation and Tracking**: Granular visibility into AI-specific resource consumption and cloud spending.
- **Automation**: Pre-configured workflows for rightsizing, scaling, and terminating idle resources.
  
## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nickpinheiro/finops-for-ai.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd finops-for-ai
   npm install  # or any other package manager based on the project
   ```
3. Configure your cloud provider settings in the `.env` file.

## Usage

1. **Monitor Cloud Costs**: Run the monitoring script to track AI-related cloud expenses.
   ```bash
   npm run monitor
   ```
2. **Run Optimization**: Analyze workloads and get optimization suggestions.
   ```bash
   npm run optimize
   ```
3. **Automate Scaling**: Use the built-in scaling tools to automatically adjust your resources.
   ```bash
   npm run scale
   ```
